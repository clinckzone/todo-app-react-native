# todo-app-react-native
What's a better way to learn React Native than implementing a classic Todo app, again?

## Features
This is a very simple app with very simple features as follows:
- Login/Logout
- Add new todos
- Edit todo status
- Delete todos 

## Demo

## Local development
Install node dependencies
```js
npm isntall
```

Start the development server
```js
npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code shown in the terminal using the Expo Go app to open the app for local development
